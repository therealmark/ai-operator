          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-500">Good. You don't need to. The most creative people we've worked with had zero technical background — and that's often what made their sidekick so interesting. We do the setup. You just show up and tell us what your life feels like.</p>

          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-500">The interesting question isn't what it changes — it's what it opens. When the things you do consistently (proposals, research, follow-ups, analysis) start happening automatically, you get a strange new resource back: the space to think bigger than you've been thinking.</p>

          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-500">For a photographer, it might write pitch emails at midnight while they dream. For a consultant, it might track six client threads so nothing slips. For a writer, it might turn a half-formed idea into a full outline before breakfast. We figure out together what "someone like you" actually needs.</p>

          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-500">No. Sidekick lives on your machine — your ideas, your clients, your creative work. It sees what you share with it and nothing else. In a world where everything is watching, this one isn't.</p>
